Made by

## Notes

All notes on the code are written inside the main file, but to recap the most important: The learning agent is working fine when playing as the first player but has very low win rate when going second

I'm not sure what the issue is but I'm not able to fix it before the deadline, so I'll upload the code as-is for now and I'll upload a new version if I find a solution

## Issues

I have reviewed the codes of
